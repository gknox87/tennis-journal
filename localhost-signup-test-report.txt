ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
------------------
1. **Form Validation Error**: 
   - Error message: "Error Please fill in all fields"
   - Appears even when all fields appear to be filled
   - Error displayed in toast notification

2. **Sport Selection Not Registering**:
   - Clicking the Padel button doesn't appear to register the selection
   - No visual indicator that sport is selected
   - Search box shows "padel" but selection may not be captured

3. **Focus Selection Not Registering**:
   - Clicking focus option doesn't show visual confirmation
   - Selection may not be properly captured by form state

4. **Password Fields**:
   - Password fields are masked (expected behavior)
   - Cannot verify if values are properly stored in form state

5. **Form Submission**:
   - "Create Account" button clickable but form doesn't submit
   - No page navigation or success message
   - Form remains on registration page

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:
----------------------
- Built with React (Vite dev server on port 5174)
- Uses Supabase for backend (based on file structure)
- Form validation appears to be client-side
- Toast notification system for error messages
- Form uses controlled components (React state management)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Add visual feedback when sport is selected (e.g., highlight/checkmark)
2. Add visual feedback when focus option is selected
3. Improve form validation error messages to indicate which specific field is missing
4. Verify that button clicks properly update form state
5. Check if password fields need to be filled in a specific order or with specific events
6. Consider adding loading state during form submission
7. Add success message or redirect after successful registration

POTENTIAL ROOT CAUSES:
---------------------
1. Form state management issue - selections may not be updating React state
2. Validation logic may be checking for values that aren't being set
3. Event handlers for sport/focus selection may not be properly wired
4. Password field values may not be accessible due to masking

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS:
-------------------
- After multiple attempts, error toast disappeared but form still didn't submit
- No network requests to Supabase auth endpoint detected
- Form validation checks for: email, password, confirmPassword, and sportId
- Default goalId is set to "performance" (which matches "Compete at a higher level")
- Sport selection requires clicking the button to trigger onSportChange callback
- Focus selection requires clicking the button to trigger onGoalChange callback

CONCLUSION:
----------
The signup form appears to have a validation issue where button clicks for sport and focus
selection may not be properly updating the React state, causing the form validation to fail
even when all fields appear to be filled. The form validation error message "Please fill in
all fields" suggests that either the sportId or one of the password fields is not being
properly captured by the form state.
