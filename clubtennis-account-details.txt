Account Information:
-------------------
Display Name: Test User
Email: test.clubtennis@example.com
Password: TestPassword123!

Issues Encountered:
------------------
1. Form submission appears non-functional - clicking "Create Account" button or pressing Enter does not submit the form

3. No console errors detected
4. Network requests to Supabase return 406 (Not Acceptable) status codes
5. Form fields clear after attempted submission
6. No success message or page navigation after form submission attempts

Technical Details:
-----------------
- Form uses standard HTML form elements
- Password field is properly masked
- All required fields are marked with "required" attribute
- Form appears to be client-side rendered (likely React/Next.js based on URL structure)
- Backend API endpoint appears to be Supabase REST API

Recommendations:
---------------
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Supabase API configuration and authentication setup
- Test with different email addresses to rule out duplicate account issues
- Check if email verification is required before account activation
- Verify form validation requirements (password strength, email format, etc.)
